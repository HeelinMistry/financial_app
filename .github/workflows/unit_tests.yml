          # If you needed 15.2 specifically, you would use:
          # sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode_15.2.app/Contents/Developer

          # For macos-latest, the default is usually the newest stable one.
          # We simply ensure the default is selected, or you can uncomment the line below.
          # sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode_<YOUR_VERSION>.app/Contents/Developer
