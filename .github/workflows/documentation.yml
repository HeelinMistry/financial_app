        run: |
          # 1. List available Xcode versions (for diagnostic output)
          echo "Listing available Xcode versions:"
          ls -F /Applications/ | grep Xcode

          # 2. Set the Xcode version your project requires
          # The macOS runner often keeps several versions.
          # You MUST specify the full path to the version you need.
          #
          # Example: If your project needs Xcode 15.2:
          # sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode_15.2.app/Contents/Developer

          # We'll use the default setup path which often points to the 'latest' stable version:
          echo "Setting current Xcode to the default available path."

          # You might need to adjust the path below if your project requires a specific, older version.
          # For macos-latest, the default link often suffices, but you can be explicit:

          # Example of being explicit for a common latest version:
          # sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode_16.0.app/Contents/Developer

          # Confirm the active version
          xcodebuild -version
